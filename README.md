# freeCodeCamp forum clone<!-- omit in toc -->

## Description

This work is inspired by the [freeCodeCamp Forum Homepage](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-freecodecamp-forum-homepage) project. It is standalone front-end application and a clone of [freeCodeCamp's 30 most recent forum posts](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/latest) page built with ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E). It is developed by the members of the freeCodeCamp community in order to develop soft skills, get more familiar with Fetch API, Git workflow and develop general coding skills. _And also, just for the sake of happy coding!_

## Installation

##### Basic Setup

In order to follow further instruction and run this project on your local machine, you will need to install:

- Javascript runtime environment - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Version control system - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Before you download anything, check if you don't have it installed already by issuing these commands to your terminal:

```sh
$ node -v
# v17.9.0
$ git --version
# git version 2.25.1
```

If you get `command not found` message, it's not installed.

_For Windows users_: I also personally recommend installing [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=us) where you can run _git-bash_ shell rather than _Command Prompt_, which will allow you typing **Linux commands on Windows**.

##### Running the project

1. Open your teminal
1. `cd` into your projects directory
1. Clone this repository to your local machine `git clone https://github.com/GITHUB-USERNAME-GOES-HERE/fcc-forum-clone.git`
1. Change to the project directory `cd fcc-forum-clone`
1. Make sure you are in the projects directory
   Linux: `pwd` should result in `/home/me/fcc-projects/fcc-forum-clone`
   Windows: Your prompt should look like this `C:\Users\Me\FCC-projects\fcc-forum-clone>`
1. Install the [dependencies](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-dependency-in-coding?share=1) using [npm](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_npm.asp) program. `npm install`
